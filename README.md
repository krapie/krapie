## Hi, I'm Kevin Park ðŸ‘‹
 
I'm a Cloud Support Engineer at Amazon Web Services (AWS).
And I'm interested in overall infrastructure, architecture, cloud, devops, distributed systems and so on.

I'm also an open source maintainer of [Yorkie](https://github.com/yorkie-team) and a member of [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes) and [Istio](https://github.com/istio), and have many other open source activities.
And I love to share my knowledge through contributing and mentoring.
